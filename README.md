# DEPRECATED - LiveSwitch HLS Demo

![code quality](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/9937a1d117224989a0cd846a43d8f957) ![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

This project has been deprecated and will no longer be supported. RTMP has been made available for LiveSwitch customers, if you still require HLS streaming you can port the RTMP stream out into your CDN provider of choice or nginx. Below are some helpful documents covering RTMP.

- [Broadcast Using RTMP](https://developer.liveswitch.io/liveswitch-server/guides/broadcast-rtmp.html)
- [RTMP Stream Layout](https://developer.liveswitch.io/liveswitch-server/guides/rtmp-stream-layout.html)

The LiveSwitch HLS Demo listens for new connections using LiveSwitch Cloud webhooks and converts them into a near-real-time HLS stream using `lsconnect` and `ffmpeg`.

The LiveSwitch HLS Demo was built using Node.js and TypeScript. It is provided as a Visual Studio solution, but Visual Studio is not required.

## Requirements

1.  [lsconnect](https://github.com/liveswitch/liveswitch-connect)
2.  [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
3.  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
4.  [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (optional)

## Getting Started

[Create a LiveSwitch Cloud application](https://console.liveswitch.io/#/applications) if you haven't already.

> LiveSwitch Server customers can use this demo as well. Simply update `gatewayUrl` in `app.ts` to point to your LiveSwitch Gateway.

Update `applicationId` and `sharedSecret` in `app.ts` to your LiveSwitch application ID and shared secret.

In a terminal, browse to `src/FM.LiveSwitch.Hls` and type:

```shell
npm install
node app.js
```

The web server is now listening for inbound webhooks.

Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) in a separate terminal to create a secure tunnel to port 3000:

```shell
ngrok http 3000
```

> Using `ngrok` is not required, but avoids the need to configure firewalls to allow inbound requests.

Finally, add a channel-level webhook for the `Connection Connected` event to your [LiveSwitch Cloud application](https://console.liveswitch.io/#/applications) pointing to your `ngrok` URL.

## Live Recording

In your `node` terminal window, you should see a URL with your application ID and shared secret:

```shell
Browse to: https://demo.liveswitch.io/#application=...&sharedsecret=...&mode=1
```

> If you see `<YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_GOES_HERE>` or `<YOUR_SHARED_SECRET_GOES_HERE>` in the URL, you missed a step from the previous section.

Open a web browser and navigate to the URL. You should see the standard LiveSwitch demo app. Join any channel, and you should see a few things happen:

1.  The `ngrok` terminal should show that an inbound POST request has been forwarded to port 3000.
2.  The `node` terminal should show logs indicating that a webhook event has been received and is being processed by `lsconnect` and `ffmpeg`.
3.  The file system should show HLS output under `src/FM.LiveSwitch.Hls/static/hls`.

Open a new browser tab and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see a list of live recordings, including the one that is currently active!

## Troubleshooting

If you are using macOS or Linux, you may need to set the executable bit on `lsconnect`:

```shell
chmod +x lsconnect
chmod +x lsconnect-macos
```
